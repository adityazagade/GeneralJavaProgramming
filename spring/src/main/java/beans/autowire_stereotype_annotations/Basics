There are 4 types of stereotype annotations
1.@Controller  ---> to be used on top of Controller classes
2.@Repository  ---> to be used on top of DAO classes
3.@Service     ---> to be used on top of Business classes
4.@Component   ---> to be used on top of non-MVC classes

com.azagade.Controller package
100 classes in it.
Use @Controller on top of it.

com.azagade.Service package
100 classes in it.
Use @Service on top of it.

com.azagade.DAO package
100 classes in it.
Use @Repository on top of it.

com.azagade.Rest package
100 classes in it.
Use @Component on top of it.

Utility Classes, Trasaction, Security, email, we need to use @aspect, But that is not a Stereotype annotation. To be studied later.

Here we will have to use schema based configuration.
Need to use context ns.
Then
<Context:component-scan base-package="com.azagade.Service"/>
<Context:component-scan base-package="com.azagade.DAO"/>
<Context:component-scan base-package="com.azagade.Rest"/>
<Context:component-scan base-package="com.azagade.Controller"/>

<Context:annotation-config/> --> This tag will activate below annotations. No need to create beans of these xxxBeanPostProcessor
@Required
@Autowire
@PostConstruct
@PreDestroy


// No need to have setters and constructors as well.

// If the class contains even a single primitive types, then we should not create the bean using @Component. Manually create the bean inside xml file.
