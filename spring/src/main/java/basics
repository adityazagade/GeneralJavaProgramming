Chapter 1:
What is spring developer name ? Rod Johnson
What is spring's original name ? Interface 21
Company ? Pivotal Organization (parent hierarchy includes Dell)
Came as alternative to EJBs (they are heavy weight, need application server, costly)
proc1 Idea: Decouple different layers of application
Implemented mostly using: RTP (run time polymorphism and association)

Chapter 2:
1. This video talks about how association is recommended by Spring over inheritance. Gives example of Servlet(I), HttpServlet(abstract C),
 GenericServlet(abstract class). This is tight dependency as we need these classes to implement any servlet.

class D {
 A a = new B();
}

interface A {}

B implements A{}

can we pass B class at runtime? Sure mention that in xml time which will be read at runtime.

Spring provides IOC containers that lets you do this ...
There are two types of IOC containers.
1. Core Container (BeanFactory (I))
2. Bean Container (ApplicationContext (I))

There is one more container in Spring MVC (WebApplicationContext(I)).

What is a container?
It provides capabilities. to do what?
1. Read xml file.
2. manage lifecycles (of POJOs)
3. dynamic inputs at runtime (this is what the Dependency Injection concept in Spring)

DI is the main concept in Spring

-----------------------Chapter 3 ---------------------------
1. How to start these containers ? For tomcat, we had some startup, stop scripts, buttons etc.
Here, we need to initialize few classes.
BeanFactory(I) --> XMLBeanFactory(C)
ApplicationContext(I) --> ConfigurableApplicationContext(I) --> ClassPathXMLApplicationContext(C)
WebApplicationContext(I) --> WebApplicationContextUtils(Factory to create some concrete impl of WebApplicationContext)

Create these classes under main method or servlet init methods.
