Intent:
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests,
queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Explanation:
There is a wizard casting spells on a goblin. The spells are executed on the goblin one by one.
The first spell shrinks the goblin and the second makes him invisible.
Then the wizard reverses the spells one by one. Each spell here is a command object that can be undone.

In plain words
Storing requests as command objects allows performing an action or undoing it at a later time.

Wikipedia says
In object-oriented programming, the command pattern is a behavioral design pattern in which an object is used to
encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
