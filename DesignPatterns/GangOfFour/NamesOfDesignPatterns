We classify design patterns by two criteria. The first criterion, called purpose

Patterns can have either creational, structural, or behavioral purpose
The second criterion, called scope, specifies whether the pattern applies primarily to classes or to objects

Creational (Creational patterns concern the process of object creation)
1. Factory (Class scope)
2. Builder
3. AbstractFactory
4. Singleton
5. Object Pool (not in GOF?)
6. Prototype

Structural (Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects)
1. Decorator
2. Adapter (Class)
3. Adapter (Object)
3. Bridge
4. Composite
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

Behavioral (Behavioral patterns characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility)
1. Interpreter (Class)
2. Template Method (Class)
3. Observer
4. Chain of responsibility
5. Command
6. Iterator
7. Mediator
8. Memento
9. State
10. Strategy
11. Visitor
